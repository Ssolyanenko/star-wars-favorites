This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).
# made by Serhii Solianenko
# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```
```
If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

Step 3: Exploring State Population Data
Now that you have successfully launched the app, let's explore state population data:

Open App.tsx in your preferred text editor and make the necessary code modifications to fetch and display state population data.

For Android: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select "Reload" from the Developer Menu (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on Windows and Linux, or <kbd>Cmd ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on macOS) to see the changes.

For iOS: Hit <kbd>Cmd ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and view the updated state population data.

App Features
Congratulations on running and modifying your React Native State Population Viewer! Now, let's take a look at some of its key features:

State Population Data: Users can browse and access population statistics for various states.
Interactive Charts: The app provides interactive charts and graphs to visualize population trends.
Search Functionality: Users can search for specific states to quickly access population information.
Comparative Analysis: Users can compare the population data of multiple states side by side.
User-Friendly UI: The app boasts an intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy navigation and data exploration.
Future Enhancements
Here are some future enhancements you can consider for your app:

Historical Data: Incorporate historical population data to enable users to analyze trends over time.
Geographical Maps: Add interactive maps to visually represent population distribution across states.
User Profiles: Allow users to create profiles and save their favorite states for quick access.
Data Sources: Provide references to the sources of population data for transparency.
Troubleshooting
